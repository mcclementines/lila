Lila's goal is to provide *good* practice questions for standardized tests by
utilizing fine-tuned large language models to generate unique questions. 

The ability to practice and do well on these tests should not be limited to those
with the resources to purchase test prep materials and tutors, which is where
Lila steps in to provide affordable (*free) access to tools which only require
a committement of time.
